            <ol>
                <li>heat 10 litres of unpasteurized milk to 38 degrees celsius in two batches.</li>
                <li>afterward pour 2 tablespoons of cheese rennet into each milk batch.</li>
                <li>when the rennet has been added the mix should be left to solidify for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>to remove the whey from the curd the mass is poured into a colander that is rotated around the edge.</li>
                <li>the now fairly solid curd is placed in a towel and squeezed until all the whey is removed.</li>
                <li>repeat the above with 5 litres of old-fashioned milk.</li>
                <li>add salt and your desired spices before the curd is completely dry.</li>
                <li>when the curd is ready it should be swept into a dry towel and placed in a mould.</li>
                <li>towel should be changed daily. the cheese should be turned every morning and evening for at least 3-4 weeks.</li>
                <li>if there is any mold it should be cut off immediately. keep the cheese on plates with weights on.</li>
                <li>the cheese should be preserved for at least 5 weeks before it is ready to be eaten.</li>
